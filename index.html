<h3>Taiwan</h3>
<p>Taipei 101, formerly known as the "Taipei World Financial Center" is a must see destination when traveling to Taiwan. 
    Located in the Xinyi District, this super tall skyscraper was known as the worlds tallest building from 2004 to 2010 until Burj Khalifa took the record. 
    In 2011 Taipei 101 received a platinum rating for becoming the tallest and largest green building in the world.
    This building contains 101 floors and has elavators that travel from floor to floor at a max speed of 37.7 mph.
    At the top of this building is a miraculous view which really highlights all of Xinyi District at night. </p>
<h4>Must try foods in Taiwan</h4> 
<p>Mango Shaved Ice <br> 
This delicacy is a treat during Taiwan's hot tropical weather. You can find a shop selling shaved ice at almost any corner in Taipei.
Because mangos are grown in Taiwan you get the freshest fruit in your dessert and can taste the juiciness of the fruit.
Not a fan of mango? NO WORRIES! There are many other flavors such as strawberry, matcha and chocolate.</p>
